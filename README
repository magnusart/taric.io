Taric IO
=====================================
This software imports, decrypts, unzips and parses TARIC product codes into a easily usable format. It does this by using the Swedish Custom Agency's tariff codes using the TARIC File disitribution (http://www.tullverket.se/sokordao/t/taric/taricfildistribution.4.4ab1598c11632f3ba9280001793.html, in Swedish).

The product codes originate from the the European Comission TARIC database (http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/tariff_aspects/customs_tariff/index_en.htm).
